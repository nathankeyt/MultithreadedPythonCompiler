# Final Project

This is the repository for our final project, which implements multi-threading, along with the *import* keyword, which allows the inclusion of dependencies in files.

# Usage

Using this is the same as all previous labs, with the inclusion of compiling multiple files concurrently. You may do this using the command

```bash
$ python3 compiler.py <file1> <file2> <...>
```

# Tests

Tests can be run similarly to previous labs. There have been a couple of new tests included, but should not change how tests are run. This includes automated tests.
